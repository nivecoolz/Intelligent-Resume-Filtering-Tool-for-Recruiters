# Intelligent-Resume-Filtering-Tool-for-Recruiters
Developed a talent-matching system to assess candidate-job fit using traditional machine learning and GPT-based NLP.

The goal of this project is to build a talent matching system that accurately matches candidatesâ€™ resumes with job descriptions to assess whether a candidate is a good fit for a given role. This problem will be approached using two distinct methodologies: one employing traditional machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques and another utilizing GPT models.

The traditional approach will involve feature extraction using NLP techniques such as TF-IDF, word embeddings (Word2Vec or GloVe), and classification algorithms such as logistic regression, support vector machines (SVM), or random forests. On the other hand, the system using GPT will leverage advanced language models to comprehend and interpret the semantic meaning of resumes and job descriptions, providing an intelligent match based on context and skills alignment.

Throughout the project, we will implement both solutions, evaluate their performance using key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, and measure computational efficiency. The outcomes of these two approaches will be compared to determine which method yields better performance in terms of predictive power, scalability, and adaptability to various industries.

By the end of this project, we aim to provide insights into the effectiveness of state-of-the-art language models like GPT compared to more conventional machine learning techniques in the domain of talent matching. These results will help guide future applications in AI-powered recruitment systems.
